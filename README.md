## Hi, I'm Dominic, an experienced technical leader and senior software engineer for cross-platform web, mobile, desktop and cloud apps, products and teams. Iâ€™m a life-long enthusiast of technology, software engineering and business.

I have been working in technology and business for over 18 years and have a proven track record in using latest technologies to develop and deliver cross-platform web, mobile, desktop and cloud solutions.

### I create tools and experiences for people

I enjoy creating tools and experiences that make life easier for people, by focusing on delivering value to the user and using creative problem solving. I architect, develop and lead the creation of well-designed, efficient code using best software development practices.

### I help build happy and productive teams

I love being part of great teams. Building teams is a joint effort but I do my part to help focus businesses so that we can build, manage and motivate cross-skilled teams. I've done this as both a consultant and in-house. I'm an advocate for building happy and productive teams, with a healthy work-life balance, by keeping things simple and taking an agile approach to life and projects.
